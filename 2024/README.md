Here are my results for the [2024 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) competition

| _Day_                     | _Stars_ | _Solution_       | _Notes_                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Day 1: Historian Hysteria | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | [python](day01/) | A relatively strait forward day of splitting an input into ints and comparing lists              |
| Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | [python](day02/) | Part 2 was a little trickier to implement reasoned logic, but recursion saves the day            |
| Day 3: Mull It Over       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | [python](day03/) | A bit of regex today, some care is needed with how the input is formatted though                 |
| Day 4: Ceres Search       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | [python](day04/) | Python automatically handling negative list indexes was the biggest debugging issue for this day |
| Day 5: Print Queue        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | [python](day05/) | Bubble bubble                                                                                    |

## Running the code

_Note_: The following commands can be modified by running setting the `YEAR` and `DAY` variables.

To run the go code, you must be in this directory before running any of the following commands. You will also need to create `input.txt` files. To create an input for the current day run:

```bash
make fetch-input
```

To run all solutions for the current year you can use:

```bash
make run
```

The run a single day (defaulting to today) use:

```bash
make run-day
```

To run the tests use:

```bash
make test
```

To only test a single day (defaulting to today) use:

```bash
make test-day
```

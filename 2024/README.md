Here are my results for the [2024 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) competition

| _Day_                        | _Stars_ | _Solution_       | _Notes_                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Day 1: Historian Hysteria |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day01/) | A relatively strait forward day of splitting an input into ints and comparing lists |
| Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day02/) | Part 2 was a little trickier to implement reasoned logic, but recursion saves the day |
| Day 3: Mull It Over |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day03/) | A bit of regex today, some care is needed with how the input is formatted though |
| Day 4: Ceres Search |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day04/) | Python automatically handling negative list indexes was the biggest debugging issue for this day |
| Day 5: Print Queue |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day05/) | Bubble bubble |
| Day 6: Guard Gallivant |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day06/) | A traditional path following puzzle today, brute forcing is quick enough but there are definitely improvements to be had |
| Day 7: Bridge Repair |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day07/) | Another day where recursion and caching allowed for intelligent traversal of the tree |
| Day 8: Resonant Collinearity |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day08/) | Take a close look at the input, it makes this day much simpler |
| Day 9: Disk Fragmenter |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [python](day09/) | The inputs held a tricky situation today and remember,. numbers can have more than one digit |

## Running the code

_Note_: The following commands can be modified by running setting the `YEAR` and `DAY` variables.

To run the go code, you must be in this directory before running any of the following commands. You will also need to create `input.txt` files. To create an input for the current day run:

```bash
make fetch-input
```

To run all solutions for the current year you can use:

```bash
make run
```

The run a single day (defaulting to today) use:

```bash
make run-day
```

To run the tests use:

```bash
make test
```

To only test a single day (defaulting to today) use:

```bash
make test-day
```
